I developed an innovative navigation system that leverages Grover's Algorithm to efficiently solve the optimal path problem in complex environments. This project utilizes quantum computing principles to enhance traditional search algorithms, significantly reducing the time required to find the best path in a given graph or grid. By employing Grover's Algorithm, which provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, I was able to identify the optimal route between points in a simulated environment. The system analyzes various potential paths, evaluating factors such as distance, obstacles, and travel time, and quickly converges on the most efficient solution. This capability is particularly beneficial for applications in logistics, transportation, and robotics.
